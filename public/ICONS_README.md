# App Icons

This folder needs the following icon files for the PWA to work properly:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 icon for mobile
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 icon for desktop
- `screenshot-mobile.png` - 540x720 mobile screenshot
- `screenshot-desktop.png` - 1280x720 desktop screenshot

## Generating Icons

You can generate these using an online tool like:

Or create them manually with your logo/design.

## Design Guidelines

- Use a transparent background or black background (#000000)
- Include the "Breakthrough" logo or wordmark
- Follow the 7 Immutable Laws aesthetic (clean, futuristic, professional)
- Use the brand colors: cyan (#06B6D4), blue (#3B82F6), purple (#8B5CF6)
